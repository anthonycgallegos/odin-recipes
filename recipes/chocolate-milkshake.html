        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
        Nothing hits the spot quite like a chocolate milkshake. For us, the ultimate chocolate shake is one that’s thick, creamy, and chocolaty, but just subtly chocolaty…like drive-thru shakes. An equally rich and satisfying vegan version had to happen!<br>

        <br>Just 7 simple ingredients required for this nostalgic treat, friends. Let’s make milkshakes! 

        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <h4>Chocolate Ice Cubes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (13.5-oz.) can full-fat coconut milk (use a smooth, creamy brand // we used Field Day)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp raw cashew butter (we like Artisana)</li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1-2 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch sea salt (omit/reduce if using salted cashew butter)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Milkshake:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolate ice cubes (from above)</li>
            <li>1/2-1 cup dairy-free milk (plain, unsweetened // we used almond)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Garnish (optional):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Whipped cream of choice (such as cashew or coconut)</li>
            <li>Fresh berries</li>
            <li>Shaved chocolate</li>
            <li>Vegan sprinkles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>Steps:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>ICE CUBES: At least 6 hours before you wish to enjoy your shakes, prepare the chocolate coconut milk ice cubes.</li>
            <li>For the ice cubes, place the coconut milk, cashew butter, maple syrup, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt into a high-speed blender and blend until smooth — about 1 minute. Taste and adjust, adding more cocoa powder or maple syrup if desired. Transfer the mixture to an ice cube tray — it should make ~14-16 standard-size ice cubes. Freeze for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>MILKSHAKE: To a high-speed blender, add all of the coconut milk ice cubes, along with 1/2 cup (120 ml) of dairy-free milk (amount as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Pulse or blend until all of the ice cubes have completely broken down and you have a thick, smooth consistency. You may need to stop and stir a few times to get it moving, or add more almond milk 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until it mixes more easily. Use the blender’s tamper if needed, pressing down to help it mix.</li>
            <li>Once you have achieved a thick and smooth consistency, serve and enjoy immediately!</li>
            <li>You can freeze leftovers back into an ice cube tray for another milkshake, or into popsicle molds for a creamy, chocolaty treat!</li>
        </ol>
