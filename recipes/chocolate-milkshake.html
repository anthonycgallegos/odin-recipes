        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
        Nothing hits the spot quite like a chocolate milkshake. For us, the ultimate chocolate shake is one that’s thick, creamy, and chocolaty, but just subtly chocolaty…like drive-thru shakes. An equally rich and satisfying vegan version had to happen!<br>

        <br>Just 7 simple ingredients required for this nostalgic treat, friends. Let’s make milkshakes!
