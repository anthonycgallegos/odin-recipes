            <li>2 Tbsp White Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Mashed Banana (120g, about 1 large ripe banana</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Coconut Oil + more for frying</li>
            <li>3/4 cup Soy Milk (180ml) or another non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced Banana</li>
            <li>Maple Syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>Steps:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and add the sugar, 
                baking powder, salt and cinnamon, mix together.</li>
            <li>Mash the banana in a bowl and add the coconut oil and 
                mash together. Add to the mixing bowl with the soy milk 
                and vanilla and mix in. Your batter will be fairly thick.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan with a little coconut oil until hot and then 
                add in some batter for your first pancake, around ¼ cup of 
                batter at a time. When the pancake starts looking dry along 
                the sides with little bubbles on top, then flip it over until 
                browned on the other side. Keep flipping and pushing down with 
                your spatula until the pancakes are very nicely browned and the 
                inside has had a chance to cook through.</li>
            <li>Serve pancakes with some sliced bananas, other fresh fruits as 
                you like and syrup for drizzling.</li>
        </ol>
