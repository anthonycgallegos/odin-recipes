        <h3><u>Description</u></h3>
        Chana masala, also called chole masala, is believed to have originated in northern India. “Chana” means chickpea and “masala” refers to a blend of spices used in Indian cooking.<br>

        <br>It’s a popular dish throughout India and Pakistan, with recipes varying by region. And it’s also gained popularity around the world. The following is our inspired version resembling what we’ve tasted in restaurants.

        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp grapeseed, coconut, or avocado oil (or other neutral oil)</li>
            <li>1 medium white or yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp sea salt (divided // plus more to taste)</li>

            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
